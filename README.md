# Weather-App
The  Flutter Weather App  allows users to search by city name and provides a 3-day forecast, including humidity, wind, and pressure. It features dynamic UI/UX with animations and background colors that change based on weather conditions and themes, all powered by the OpenWeatherMap API for real-time data.
